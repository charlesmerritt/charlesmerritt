# Hi, I'm Chaz 👋
I'm an Artificial Intelligence student and researcher at the University of Georgia with a focus on markov chains, digital forestry, and reinforcement learning. More specifically my work focuses on integrating probabilistic machine learning technology into timber planning for the modern forester, GIS analyst, or land owner to be better equipped for making decisions under uncertainty.

## Current Projects
### Harnessing Reinforcement Learning for Forest Growth Modeling Under Uncertainty
My master's thesis project! It's all about creating a markov model of the forest to better capture random events like storms, fires, or pests, and then training an agent on that environment using reinforcement learning.
